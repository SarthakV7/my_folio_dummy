I am a freelance Data Scientist currently working in collaboration with [Stellenbosch University](http://www.sun.ac.za/english){:target="\_blank"} on a research project for diagnosis of COVID-19 through cough audio using deep learning.

Apart from freelancing, I am working as an Associate Data Scientist at [Ernst & Young (EY)](https://www.ey.com/en_in){:target="\_blank"} where my day to day tasks involve using quantitative and qualitative methods to test hypotheses, building ML models, and identifying emerging trends related to a range of strategically important business topics. I am also working part time at [Applied Roots](https://www.appliedroots.com/){:target="\_blank"}, where, one of the major tasks is mentoring our students, evaluating, debugging their assignments, and giving them the right feedback.
I am a part of the team where we evaluate over 600 assignments on an average daily, mentor our students, and resolve queries pertaining Data Science.
Apart from the evaluation, guidance, and queries resolution, we are also responsible for updating the assignments to keep them in pace with the
AI/Data Science industry.

Before starting my career in Data Science, I was a Xamarin iOS developer at [Redallcco infotech](https://www.redaallco.com/){:target="\_blank"}.
And at that point of time, I realized the enormous possibilities of humans and computers working together to harvest the power of data for developing techniques that could not only be utilized by businesses for tremendous growth but also be used across numerous research domains by providing new data driven approaches.

This was exciting enough to get me started with wrapping my head around data science and dive deeper into the specifics of what makes these algorithms so powerful that in some domains, they are even capable of outperforming humans.
I started investing more and more of my free time in utilizing resources like online courses and certifications, participating in data challenges and sharing my skills by writing blogs and developing projects on applications of data science in multiple domains.

In 2019, I gave up my role as Xamarin developer at [Redallcco infotech](https://www.redaallco.com/){:target="\_blank"} and started investing all of my time in developing skills in data. As of now, I am working on some research projects in the domain of applications of ML/DL in bioinformatics, working part time at Applied Roots and freelancing as a Data Scientist to help businesses solve modern problems using modern data driven approaches.
