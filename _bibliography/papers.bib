  title={Predicting mortality risk in patients suffering from hepatocellular carcinoma using machine learning.},
  author={Sarthak Vajpayee, , and Akansha Mangal,},
  abstract={Liver cancer is one of the most recurrent detected cancers in the world. The most common type of liver cancer is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) which begins in the cells called hepatocytes. It can be cured with surgery or transplant if detected early but is incurable in more advanced cases. The exact cause of HCC is unknown but there are some underlying problems like hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus, autoimmune hepatitis, and heavy drinking that increase the risk of HCC. In this paper, a dataset of 165 patients has been studied to predict the chances of survival from HCC. The dataset contains 23 quantitative and 26 qualitative variables with 10.22% missing data. In our approach, we first standardized the data and then handled the missing values by comparing four different imputation techniques including mean, median, KNN, and random-forest based MICE. After imputation, ANOVA F-value and mutual information were used to select the relevant features. The prepared data was then studied on five classifiers: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random-Forest, Bagging-Classifier, and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). The MLP based classifier and random-forest based MICE imputation technique and feature selection produced the best results with an accuracy of 90.02% and f1-score of 0.914. With these results, we can say that this machine-learning based approach can be effectively used for predicting mortality risk in patients suffering from HCC.},

  title={Deep learning for COVID-19 classification using cough audio.},
  author={Sarthak Vajpayee, Madhurananda Pahar, and Thomas Niesler,},
  abstract={Abstract—In this paper, we present a deep learning based COVID-19 cough classifier which is able to discriminate the coughingaudio of COVID-19 positive users from COVID-19 non-positive (COVID-19 negative and healthy) users.  This classifier can beapplied for an early screening of COVID-19 and since it requires cough audio that can be made available using a smartphone, itmakes the classifier easier to use for self-diagnostics and eliminates the transmission of COVID-19 due to contact while testing. Thedataset used in this study is a blend of two crowdsourced publicly available datasets collected and prepared by IISC-Bangalore andEPFL. IISC-Bangalore’s COSWARA dataset contains audio recordings of 1184 patients who are either healthy or have recoveredfrom COVID-19 and 107 patients who are COVID-19 positive, whereas the processed EPFL’s COUGHVID dataset contains audiorecordings  of  1133  patients  who  are  healthy  and  397  patients  who  are  COVID-19  positive. The  machine  learning  algorithmsconsidered for the classification of the audio include multilayer perceptron (MLP), GRU based recurrent neural network (RNN),convolutional neural network (CNN), OxfordNet (VGG-16), ResNet-50. Results show that the transfer learning based on ResNet-50 neural network architecture outperformed the other classifiers in predicting whether cough audio corresponds to a healthy patientor a COVID-19 positive patient and achieved specificity of 90%, sensitivity of 93%, AUC score of 0.96, and accuracy of 92.78%},
